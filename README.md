- What problem or challenge led to Web Assembly?
	- 

- What is Web Assembly? Are there different definitions and understandings, or are people united in what it entails?
	- WASM describes a standard maintained by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/)  group, meaning there are maintainers from all major browsers implementing features in their browsers and developing the standard. WASM is essentially a binary format which is a compilation target for compiled languages.

- Who owns or maintains it?
	- W3C, answered above

- Is it a standard or an implementation? Who maintains the standard? Who implements it?
	- W3C sub-group maintains the standard, 4 (3) major browsers implement WASM, meaning WASM can run in them.

- Which browsers support it?
	- All major, firefox, safari and chromium based

- A hello-world example in WebAssembly

- What can one do with WebAssembly?
	- Mostly everything you can do with javascript. Algorithms ran with near-native performance.

- Is there something one canâ€™t do?
	- Compiling garbage collected languages seem to be a problem, MORE RESEARCH HERE...

- Which languages are supported?
	- Easily? C, C++, rust
	- Other non-garbage collected languages might work perfectly fine
	- There are frameworks in languages that are garbage collected (go, c#...) that can compile(?) to wasm, LOOK INTO IT.

- Is WebAssembly running in the browser only, or can it run on backend?

- How does the architecture look like, the pipeline? How does it look like technically?

- What happens when an HTML page is reloaded?

- Can WebAssembly access cookies?

- Can one youse JS libraries and call JS functions from WebAssembly? How about the other way around?

- How can one get started?

	- What tools are necessary? Compilers? Transpilers? Interpreters?

- Which operating systems are supported?

- What would be a good use-case / example for Web Assembly?

- Describe that example.

- Implement that example in different languages.
